Exercise 2
Add bootstrap (or other framework) styling to your CV website that you developed the other day. 
Use Bootstrapâ€™s existing components to give all the elements of your page a consistent look (e.g., the navigation bar, the form items, etc.). 
The website should be responsive and adapt the size and disposition of the items according to the device size. 
Also feel free to use a Bootstrap theme (from bootswatch.com). 
In addition to the bootstrap styles, add your own CSS rules to further customize the content (at least 5 new rules).

If you haven't completed last week's assignment, you can use the cv.zip website attached to this assignment.
